//read me
//the point im at with this is near half way.
//i have to figure out how to have a natural note off when the user is playing, because it
    plays the note to the alotted duration.
    essentially finding a way to differentiate a natural noteoff vs what the wedmidi is processing
//im then going to have to set up some sort of array to be able to make the tempo of the function 
    varied.
//another problem im having is once the note is off, it doesnt play anything after- im guessing
    its because i havent set up my array function for it to work.

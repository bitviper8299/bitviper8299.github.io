first we need to get signal from fl
make io drivers port 1
midi device to 0

routing
route midi data to time clock
/time clock being noteon / noteoff messages
/the clock that webmidi runs on is the bones meat and flesh to this project. since we are dealing with midi data, it is a bit more compkicated n how we control the gate ( relating to the tempo of gate, how long the gate is active ((essentially wet/dry signals))

we work around this by controlling the paramters of
/how long each note is on for as well as
//how quick the note turns off
we then use the tempo nob to control the ENITRE clock. this shows the rate of which the noteon/noteoff messages are played for

/april 7 2024 read me
the point im at with this is near half way.
i have to figure out how to have a natural note off when the user is playing, because it
plays the note to the alotted duration.
essentially finding a way to differentiate a natural noteoff vs what the wedmidi is processing
im then going to have to set up some sort of array to be able to make the tempo of the function
varied.
another problem im having is once the note is off, it doesnt play anything after- im guessing
its because i havent set up my array function for it to work.
